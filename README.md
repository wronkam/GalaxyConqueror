# Galaxy Conqueror
<b>Galaxy Conqueror is an endless arcade-style space shooter game</b>
## Features:
- Score system
- Various kinds of enemies
- Power-ups with randomized effects
- Local highscores that keeps track of your 8 best scores
- Progressively increasing difficulty</br>
## Controls:
- Use arrow keys to move
- Use A and D keys to rotate your spaceship
- Press SPACE to shoot</br>
## Setup:
1. Clone the repository <code> git clone https://github.com/wronkam/GalaxyConqueror.git </code> </br>
2. Import Project in IntelliJ IDEA using pom.xml file (Intellij might ask to download JDK 11 in some iterration, which is an essential asset)</br>
3. In Project Structure add /lib subfolder of javafx library in version 11 or newer </br>
4. Compile and run App.java class </br>

5. It might be helpful to add run configuration for App.java class and add the following line to VM options</br>
<code>--module-path (your javafx path here)/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media</code> </br>

.jar version is still in development and we hope it will arive some day and end our strugle, as a result seting our game to work on Windows could be complicated. Linux and as a result MacOS users should have it a bit easier
